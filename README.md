**Final Project Topic:** 
Gender discrimination in STEM fields is a prominent human rights issue that manifests itself via job segregation, employment inequity, the pay gap, and a general lack of freedom in choice of career for women around the world. This topic aims to better understand how gender inequality has evolved over time and by geography. As women in tech, we specifically want to hone in on gender inequities in STEM fields and assess how test scores, school participation, labor participation, salaries, and media portrayal vary by men and women. The following datasets provide the information to thoroughly investigate this subject.
